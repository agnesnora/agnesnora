### Hi there 👋

I am Agnes from Hungary. Self-learner, career changer, front-end developer (to be). Since the day of stepping in the world of coding I can't stop studying, and training myself. I am currently doing a Front-end carrer path on www.scrimba.com and I am also a student of the web developer bootcamp of Front-end Foxes :fox_face:.
